## yProv Command Line Interface (CLI)

The yProv CLI provides a set of commands, which are basically Python wrappers to the RESTful API calls designed for the yProv service.

Five classes of resources have been identified, namely document, entity, activity, agent and relation. For each, it is possible to perform the CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

The generic usage is:
```
flask RESOURCE COMMAND [ARGS]
```

where ```RESOURCE = ["activities", "agents", "documents", "elements", "entities", "relations"]```
and ```COMMAND = ["create","delete","get","update"]```

To get further information about a specific resource (e.g., documents) and command (e.g., get), you can simply run

```
flask documents get --help
```

Here is the full list of available commands and how to use them.
