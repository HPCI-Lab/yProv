    "description": "yProv is a provenance service aimed at addressing multi-level provenance as well as reproducibility challenges in climate analytics experiments. It allows scientists to manage provenance information compliant with the W3C PROV standard in a more structured way and navigate and explore the provenance space across multiple dimensions, thus enabling the possibility to get coarse- or fine-grained information according to the level of interest. yProv is a joint project between University of Trento and CMCC.",
